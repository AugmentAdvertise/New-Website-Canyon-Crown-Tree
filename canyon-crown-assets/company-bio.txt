Canyon Crown Tree - Company Bio

At Canyon Crown Tree, we specialize in safe, efficient tree care, helping Utah homeowners and businesses protect their properties and enhance their landscapes. Founded in 2010 by Alex Rivera, an ISA-certified arborist with over 15 years of hands-on experience, our company has grown from a one-person operation into Salt Lake City's most trusted tree care team.

Alex's passion for trees began during summers spent hiking the Wasatch Range, where he developed a deep respect for Utah's native ecosystems. After earning a degree in Forestry from Utah State University and obtaining his ISA certification, Alex founded Canyon Crown Tree with a simple mission: provide honest, expert tree care that prioritizes safety, sustainability, and customer satisfaction.

Today, our crew of 12 trained professionals handles everything from routine pruning to complex removals and 24/7 emergency storm response. We're fully licensed, bonded, and insured, carrying $2 million in liability coverage for your peace of mind. Our fleet includes bucket trucks, cranes, stump grinders, and chippers — all maintained to the highest safety standards.

What sets us apart is our commitment to the health of your trees and the environment. We practice integrated pest management, use eco-friendly methods wherever possible, and recycle 100% of the wood and green waste we collect. We believe every tree deserves an expert evaluation before any work begins, which is why we offer free on-site consultations with a certified arborist.

Whether you need a dangerous tree removed, a mature oak expertly pruned, or guidance on the best species to plant in Utah's climate, Canyon Crown Tree is here to help. We treat every property as if it were our own and every customer like family.
