                        <h2 class="section-title">Rooted in Salt Lake City Since 2010</h2>

                        <p>Canyon Crown Tree was born out of one man's deep connection to the landscapes of Northern Utah. As a young man, Alex Rivera spent every free weekend hiking the Wasatch Range, scrambling up Big Cottonwood Canyon, and marveling at the towering Engelmann spruces and ancient Douglas firs that blanket these mountains. It was during those formative years that Alex developed an enduring respect for the trees that define Utah's natural beauty and learned just how vital they are to the health of our local ecosystems.</p>

                        <p>That passion led Alex to Utah State University, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Forestry. His coursework covered everything from tree biology and soil science to urban forest management, giving him the scientific foundation that still guides every decision Canyon Crown Tree makes today. After graduating, Alex pursued and earned his ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) certification, a credential that fewer than one-third of working arborists hold and one that requires continuing education to maintain.</p>

                        <p>In 2010, Alex founded Canyon Crown Tree with a single pickup truck, a climbing harness, and a commitment to doing things the right way. Word spread quickly through Salt Lake City's neighborhoods: here was an arborist who actually listened, explained his recommendations in plain language, and never pushed unnecessary work. Within three years, the one-person operation had grown into a full-service tree care company with a dedicated crew, bucket trucks, and a reputation for exceptional work.</p>

                        <p>Today, Canyon Crown Tree employs 12 trained professionals who share Alex's passion for arboriculture and his uncompromising approach to safety. From routine pruning in Holladay to emergency storm response in Park City, we bring the same level of expertise and care to every job. We have served thousands of residential and commercial clients across the Wasatch Front, and we are proud to be the tree care company that Salt Lake City trusts most.</p>

                        <p class="value-card__text">Every member of our crew follows strict OSHA-compliant safety protocols on every job, no exceptions. We conduct daily safety briefings, maintain all equipment to manufacturer specifications, and carry $2 million in liability insurance. Our zero-incident commitment means we never cut corners, even when it takes a little longer to do the job right.</p>

                        <p class="value-card__text">When our certified arborists evaluate your trees, you get a straightforward recommendation based on science, not upselling. If a tree can be saved with proper pruning and treatment, we will tell you. If it needs to come down, we will explain exactly why. Transparent pricing, detailed written estimates, and no surprise charges are the standards we hold ourselves to.</p>

                        <h3 class="value-card__title">Environmental Stewardship</h3>
                        <p class="value-card__text">We recycle 100% of the wood and green waste we collect, turning it into mulch, firewood, and lumber whenever possible. Our integrated pest management approach minimizes chemical use, and we actively promote tree planting to expand Salt Lake City's urban canopy. We believe every tree removed should be replaced with a species suited to Utah's changing climate.</p>

That means showing up on time, communicating clearly throughout the process, cleaning up thoroughly when the work is done, and following up to make sure you are completely satisfied.
